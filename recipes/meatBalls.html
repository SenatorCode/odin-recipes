    <h1>Algerian Kefta Meat Balls</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Ground meat dishes are very common in the cookery of Muslim communities, and these Algerian kefta meatballs are pretty traditional. They can also make for a terrific appetizer to add to your repertoire.</p>
    <p>This simple meatball dish is delicious, rich, and fresh. The tomato sauce can be used for anything and the amounts of flavors can be adjusted. I like a lot of garlic and pepper. I have also found halal hamburger to be much leaner and lighter than regular. You can find it at international food stores and halal butcher shops in bigger cities. Serve this dish with a French baguette.</p>
